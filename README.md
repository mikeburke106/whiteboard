### Whiteboard Challenge

You’ve decided the world needs another (better, of course) drawing app for Android.  You want your drawing app to be simple but delightful.  To make your app useful, your app is going to have the following basic features:

1. Users will be able to draw on a blank canvas (whiteboard).
2. Users will be able to erase what has been drawn.
3. Users will be able to undo and redo drawing paths.
4. Users will be able to draw using a color of their choice from at least these colors: black, dark gray, light gray, blue, red, green, orange, yellow.
5. Users will be able to capture a screen shot and email it to a friend.

To make your app standout, you have a few other ideas that you think users will want.

- Users will want to set the thickness of the drawing tool.
- Users will want to draw on top of a photo they’ve taken (or take a new photo), for example to draw a funny mustache on a selfie.
- Users will want to watch the playback of their drawing happen.
- Users will want to place and resize predefined shapes (vectors) on screen, for example a rectangle, triangle or ellipse.

##### Instructions

You are free to make design and architectural choices in this challenge.  We encourage you to be creative.  However, we do have some minimum requirements:

1. Must be able to run on phones equipped with Android 4.1+.
2. Must include the 5 basic features and at least one of the additional features.

While we require the app to run on phones, you are encouraged to make the app capable to run on tablets as well.  Rotation is not required, but preferred.  You are free to use Gradle, Maven or other open source tools if you wish to do so.

##### Important Notes

1. Create a private github repository and invite: adeviadoug to the repo. Doug likes to watch the commit stream to see your thinking process.  Please commit early and often (within reason) so he can see the evolution of the app.
2. Have fun! If you would like to add additional features (beyond the requirements) to the app, feel free to do so.
3. Send Doug an email (doug@varsitytutors.com) once you’re done with the app, include the URL to the github submission (this makes it easier for him to find).
4. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  All questions and any comments that you have post submission (which are helpful in our code review) will be passed along during the code review
